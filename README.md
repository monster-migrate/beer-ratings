# Predicting Overall Beer Ratings: A Data Science Case Study

This project aims to predict the overall beer ratings based on user reviews and beer characteristics. The dataset includes features such as beer style, ABV (alcohol by volume), IBU (International Bitterness Units), and user ratings. Various machine learning models are used to predict beer ratings, with the goal of achieving an accurate and robust prediction model.

## Project Overview

In this notebook, we analyze a dataset of beer ratings and use machine learning to predict the overall rating of beers. The project leverages techniques like data preprocessing, feature engineering, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning to build an effective model. 

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for machine learning.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that capture important patterns in the data.
- **Modeling**: Using algorithms such as Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and H2O AutoML.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like mean absolute error (MAE) and R-squared to assess the model's performance.

## Key Findings

- **Feature Importance**: User demographics and review components (appearance, aroma, palate, taste) are crucial in predicting beer ratings.
- **Model Performance**: Non-linear models, like Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, captured complex relationships, but their performance was similar to linear models.
- **Clustering Insights**: Clustering algorithms such as K-means revealed distinct patterns, helping in feature creation to improve model accuracy.

## Future Work

- **Enhanced Feature Engineering**: Experimenting with interaction and polynomial features to improve model performance.
- **Advanced Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilizing Bayesian optimization techniques (e.g., Optuna or Hyperopt) for further fine-tuning.
- **Neural Networks**: Exploring deep learning models for capturing non-linear patterns.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models through stacking and blending to improve prediction robustness.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how various machine learning models and techniques can be applied to predict beer ratings. The models consistently achieved good performance, and there are several avenues for future improvements to make predictions even more accurate.
